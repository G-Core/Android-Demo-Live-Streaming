# G-Core Labs Demo â€“ Stream Live Video Online on Android
# Introduction
Set up live streaming in 15 minutes in your Android project instead of 7 days of work and setting wild parameters of codecs, network, etc. This demo project is a quick tutorial how to stream live video from your own mobile app to an audience of 1 000 000+ viewers like Instagram, Youtube, etc.
# Features
1. Authorization 
2. HLS & MPEG-DASH playback
3. RTMP streaming
5. Creating a new live stream
6. Camera switching
7. Mute mode
8. Video:
    * Network adaptive bitrate mechanism
    * Source: front and back cameras
    * Orientation: portrait
    * Codec: AVC/H.264
    * Configurable bitrate, resolution, iFrameInterval, encoder profile
9. Audio:
    * Codec: AAC
    * Configurable bitrate, sample rate, stereo/mono
    * Processing: noise suppressor, echo cancellation
# Testing the app with your G-Core Labs account
1. You can clone this project and run it in Android Studio, where you can test it either by connecting a real device or through an Android emulator
2. Sign in with your G-Core-Labs account email and password.
3. On the Streams screen, you can watch the available streams
4. On the Select stream screen, you can select/create a stream to start streaming
5. On the Start Broadcast screen, you can start broadcasting, set the video quality, and select push url or backup push url for streaming

# Quick Start
### 1. Compile
You will need a third party library to implement RTMP streaming. In this project, [rtmp-rtsp-stream-client-java](https://github.com/pedroSG94/rtmp-rtsp-stream-client-java) was used. To use it, you need to specify this in your build.gradle:
``` gradle
allprojects {
  repositories {
    maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
  }
}
dependencies {
  implementation 'com.github.pedroSG94.rtmp-rtsp-stream-client-java:rtplibrary:2.1.7'
}
```
### 2. Permissions
In order to broadcast, you will also need an internet connection, a camera and a microphone. To use them, add the following permissions to your app's AndroidManifest.xml file:
``` xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"/>
```
### 3. Layout
To display the stream from the camera on the smartphone screen, you will need OpenGlView, which is implemented in the library used.
``` xml
<com.pedro.rtplibrary.view.OpenGlView
        android:id="@+id/openGlView"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="match_parent"
        android:keepScreenOn="true"
        android:visibility="gone"

        app:keepAspectRatio="true"
        app:aspectRatioMode="adjust"/>
```
### 4. Start streaming
Streaming with default params:
``` kotlin
val rtmpCamera2 = RtmpCamera2(openGlview, connectCheckerRtmp)

if (rtmpCamera2.prepareAudio() && rtmpCamera2.prepareVideo()) {
   rtmpCamera2.startStream("rtmpUrl")
}
rtmpCamera2.stopStream()
```
Streaming with custom params:
``` kotlin
val rtmpCamera2 = RtmpCamera2(openGlview, connectCheckerRtmp)

val audioIsReady = rtmpCamera2.prepareAudio(
   bitrate: Int,
   sampleRate: Int,
   isStereo: Boolean,
   echoCanceler: Boolean,
   noiseSuppressor: Boolean
)

val videoIsReady = rtmpCamera2.prepareVideo(
   width: Int,
   height: Int,
   fps: Int,
   bitrate: Int,
   iFrameInterval: Int,
   rotation: Int
)

if (audioIsReady && videoIsReady) {
   rtmpCamera2.startStream("rtmpUrl")
}
rtmpCamera2.stopStream()
```
You can find out how to get rtmpUrl for streaming in the G-Core-Labs API [documentation](https://apidocs.gcorelabs.com/streaming#tag/Streams).
